Xtend 2.25.0 is a maintenance release.

## Call to Action: Secure the future maintenance of Xtext & Xtend

As you might have recognized, the number of people contributing to Xtext & Xtend on a regular basis has declined over the past years and so has the number of contributions. At the same time the amount of work for basic maintenance has stayed the same or even increased with the new release cadence of Java and the Eclipse simultaneous release. Briefly: The future maintenance of Xtext & especially Xtend is at risk, at least in the current form and as part of the Eclipse Simrel. If you care, please join the discussion in [https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721).

## Updates

* Xtend now makes use of Guava 30.1.

## Enhancements

* [#1029](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/1029): Xtend now generates less unused imports (classes from the same package).
* [#1147](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/1147): `serialVersionUID` is no longer flagged as unused.
