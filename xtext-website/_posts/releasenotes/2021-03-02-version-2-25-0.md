Xtext 2.25.0 is a maintenance release.

## Call to Action: Secure the future maintenance of Xtext

As you might have recognized, the number of people contributing to Xtext on a regular basis has declined over the past years and so has the number of contributions. At the same time the amount of work for basic maintenance has stayed the same or even increased with the new release cadence of Java and the Eclipse simultaneous release. Briefly: The future maintenance of Xtext is at risk, at least in the current form and as part of the Eclipse Simrel. If you care, please join the discussion in [https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721).

## Documentation

The [LSP Support](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/340_lsp_support.html) section has been added to the Xtext documentation.

## Upgrades

* MWE(2) was updated to 2.12.1/1.6.1.
* Xtext now uses Guava 30.1, ASM 9.1 and GSON 2.8.6.

## Bugfixes

* [xtext-core#1648](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/issues/1648): A regression in JUnit 5 API was fixed. It should work well again.
* [xtext-core#1655](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/issues/1655): The ANTLR option `k` in the workflow works now as expected.
* `XbaseInterpreter` now correctly handles the `return;` statement.

## Enhancements

* The `Formatter2` is now flagged as API.
* The Java API for `Formatter2` learned a new, more fancy syntax. e.g. instead of `it -> it.noSpace()` you now can write `this::noSpace`.
* The `TemplateNewFileWizard` and `NewFileWizardPrimaryPage` API is opened up to allow for easier customization.
